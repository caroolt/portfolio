# Portfolio Website Description
## Technical Architecture & User Experience Flow

Despite being a Single Page Application (SPA), I meticulously crafted the user experience to feel like a multi-page website with seamless transitions between different sections. The navigation flow creates an engaging, story-driven experience:

**The Journey Begins**: Users start at the hero section, and as they scroll down, they discover key qualities and skills that define my professional identity.

**The Decision Point**: The experience then presents users with a strategic choice between two paths - "Projects" or "Experience" - creating an interactive decision-making moment that feels like branching navigation.

**Seamless Transitions**: When users select either path, the application performs a smooth scroll transition to the next section. Despite this feeling like continuous scrolling within the same page, I've architected it so that each section is technically a separate page component, maintaining clean code organization while preserving the fluid user experience.

**Complete Exploration**: After users scroll through all content in their chosen path (whether all projects or all professional experiences), they're presented with an elegant redirection option to explore the alternative path they didn't initially choose.

**Flexible Navigation**: Users maintain complete control - they can either explore the second path or simply continue scrolling to reach the final landing section, creating a non-linear but intuitive exploration experience.

This sophisticated flow demonstrates advanced UX thinking combined with technical execution, creating an engaging portfolio journey that encourages comprehensive exploration while never feeling forced or restrictive.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using modern web technologies:
- **React with Vite** for fast development and optimized build performance
- **TypeScript** for type-safe, maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for smooth, professional animations and transitions
- **i18n (Internationalization)** for multi-language support
- **Figma** for comprehensive UI/UX design and prototyping

## Design Process

I handled the entire design process in Figma, creating detailed mockups, component systems, and interaction flows before moving to development. This allowed me to establish a cohesive visual identity and user experience strategy that guides every aspect of the site.

## Portfolio Content
The website serves as a comprehensive showcase of my professional journey, featuring:
